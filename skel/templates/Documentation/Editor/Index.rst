For Editors

How to use the extension from the perspective of an editor.

Think of common tasks that an editor is likely to perform:

- How do they complete them?
- What problems are they likely to encounter?
- What access do they require?
- What configuration options are available to them?

One example could be adding a frontend plugin to a page and then configuring it.

Language should be non-technical, aim to avoid using acronyms where possible.

Be mindful that editors typically don't have administrative access to the installation.
